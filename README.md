# [AMM Decentralized Exchange:](https://dexes-front-gz8v98toz-0x4152.vercel.app/)

##### This is an exercise to put into practice a Dex based on Uniswap's V1 protocol with educational purposes only,
as a pair that exchanges native ETH with DEX tokens, an ERC20. The exchange price is regulated by an automatic market making formula.

**It has two pages:**

#### 1. DEX:


This page is the Decentralized Exchange interface, where users can exchange ETH for DEX. It also has two different representations of the exchanges:

- A Bar chart that helps the user understand how assets are being added and subtracted from the liquidity pool.
- A graph where we can see represented the different ratios the liquidity pool can achieve leveraging the constant product formula, and how it affects the price.

#### 2. Multi-Sig:



The Multi-Sig controls the issuance of the DEX token, and is used to understand how transactions are called in a Multi-Sig wallet. This contract gives the user the posibility of minting DEX tokens, to use in the DEX.
